Now when you climb
Into your bed tonight
And when you lock
And bolt the door
Just think of those
Out in the cold and dark
'Cause there's not enough love to go 'round
No, there's not enough love to go 'round

And sympathy is what we need, my friend
And sympathy is what we need
And sympathy
Is what we need, my friend
'Cause there's not enough love to go 'round
No, there's not enough love to go 'round
